# ReSTORErant 

:hamburger:Connect your restaurant to local wholesalers easier than ever before!

### What Does ReSTORErant Do?

Through heart-wrenching stories of our favorite local places closing, we developed an understanding of just how restaurants and small businesses are suffering. For them, it is difficult to attract and maintain customers, to find the needed products, and to predict demand, all while trying to stay afloat and improve their revenue. 

Through our research, the reSTORErant team discovered that a lack of a consolidated information database on the inventory of wholesalers is making it difficult for restaurants to find vital products at their usual suppliers. In turn, this makes it extremely difficult for restaurant owners to determine their supply, and topped with the unpredictable demand, restaurant owners are being forced to either operate at a loss or shut down.

To solve this problem, we created a website where small restaurants could search wholesalers nearby to find the closest location with the necessary items, while also being able to compare prices. By building a bridge to better connect restaurants and wholesalers, we are not only boosting the economy, but also saving small businesses and restaurant owners some time and money they especially need during these times.

### Key Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks
#### React

React allows us to break down our codebase to a component level. It facilitates collaboration in our squad as it allows Alan and I to build components in parallel without interfering with each other. Even better, its JSX syntax allows us to put everything, including the style, the logic, and the HTML template all in one place, which keeps things organized. Also, we personally want to avoid hard-wired data binding with jQuery. Because we thought our app will mainly encompass data, passing the data around using jQuery will certainly be a nightmare, so it’s necessary for us to pick a library that supports data binding. Last but not the least, to ease the transition to mobile, we picked React to get ready for that, as React Native can help us ease this transition. 

#### Material-UI

Because our squad does not have a designer, we decided to pick a UI framework to save our time and effort from designing our website. With the purpose of moving this app to mobile platforms in mind, we decided on Material-UI because it mimics a look similar to that of a mobile app. 

#### Material Kit 

We utilized material Kit react for a better appearance and easier implementation. This kit overall gives the website a modern and lively morale. It also has a plethora of previously designed icons, tools and templates we can choose from. We borrowed a free licensed, free download template from one of the online designers named Creative Tim, as it provides a smooth aesthetic for our front page and log in page. The style that Material Kit React also suits well for our theme as it gives it a well-rounded touch. 

#### Google Forms & Sheets

One of our coaches said her team uses Google Forms and Google Sheets when she prototyped her backend. After doing some research, we set up an experimental environment to test it out. We found it quite amazing: it’s fast and stable, and it even comes with a GUI for free. And while it does come with a few limitations though, we believe it is good for a prototype.
